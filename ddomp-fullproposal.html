					<h2>Data and Digital Outputs Management Approach</h2>	
					<p>In the Data and Digital Outputs Management section of the BFGO proposal template, researchers should address the following questions and elaborate on the information provided at the Pre-Proposal Stage, where appropriate. Included here are resources for Belmont Forum researchers to address each question correctly and comprehensively:</p><br/>
					<ol>
						<li><strong>What types of datasets and other digital outputs of long-term value do you expect that the project will produce or reuse?</strong></li>
							<ul>
								<li>Considering which data and digital outputs you would like to preserve during and after your research project will help your research team understand how to organize your data management infrastructure and anticipate certain costs. For best practices on identifying data with long-term value, please visit the following resources:</li> 
									<ul style="list-style-type:square">
										<li><a href="https://www.dataone.org/best-practices/decide-what-data-preserve" target="_blank">DataONE: Decide what data to preserve</a></li>
										<li><a href="https://www.dataone.org/best-practices/identify-data-long-term-value" target="_blank">DataONE: Identify data with long-term value</a></li>
										<li><a href="https://www.dataone.org/best-practices/store-data-appropriate-precision" target="_blank">DataONE: Store data with appropriate precision</a></li>
									</ul>
							</ul>
						<li><strong>How do you intend to ensure that the data and digital outputs from your project conform to the <a href="http://www.belmontforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Belmont-Forum-Data-Policy-and-Principles.pdf" target="_blank">Belmont Forum Open Data Policy and Principles</a> and the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618" target="_blank">FAIR principles</a>?</strong></li>
							<ul>
								<li>The Belmont Forum Open Data Policy and Principles, adopted in 2015, are listed below with specific resources to aid in fulfilling each requirement:</li>
									<ul style="list-style-type:square">
										<li>Data should be discoverable through catalogues and search engines</li>
											<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
												<li>Ensure that your data (with respect to any confidentiality and legality constraints) is housed in a reputable data repository that can be accessed openly through catalogues and search engines. To find a reputable data repository for your research project, go to <a href="https://www.re3data.org/" target="_blank">https://www.re3data.org/</a></li>.
											</ul>
										<li>Accessible as open data by default, and made available with minimum time delay</li>
										<li>Understandable in a way that allows researchers - including those outside the discipline of origin - to use them</li>
										<li>Manageable and protected from loss for future use in sustainable, trustworthy repositories.</li>
									</ul>
								<li>The FAIR principles are listed below with specific resources to aid in fulfilling each requirement:</li>
									<ul style="list-style-type:square">
										<li>Findability</li>
										<li>Accessiblity</li>
										<li>Interoperability</li>
										<li>Reusability</li>
									</ul>
							</ul>
						<li><strong>Which member(s) of your team will be responsible for developing, implementing, overseeing, and updating the Data and Digital Outputs Management Plan?</strong></li>
							<ul>
								<li>While all members of your research team should understand and support data management best practices within your project, it is important to delegate the development, implementation, oversight, and maintenance of the DDOMP to collaborators on your team who possess the necessary skillsets and training. For more resources on what to consider as you designate a data manager, please visit the following links:</li>
									<ul style="list-style-type:square">
										<li><a href="https://www.dataone.org/best-practices/define-roles-and-assign-responsibilities-data-management" target="_blank">DataONE: Define roles and assign responsibilities for data management</a></li>
										<li><a href="https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/manage-data/plan/roles-and-responsibilities" target="_blank">UK Data Service: Roles and Responsibilities of data management teams and collaborators</a></li>
									</ul>	
								<li>Does your research team currently lack experience in data management training and best practices? Consider getting up to speed using our <a href="https://bfe-inf.github.io/tool-kit/" target="_blank">e-Infrastructures & Data Management Tool Kit</a>, which contains location- and organization-specific resources on data management training, certifications, best practices, and more. Prior to submitting a project for funding through a Belmont Forum partner organization, members of your research team should have a general understanding of data management in order to properly complete this portion of the DDOMP.</li>
							</ul>
						<li><strong>How do you intend to manage the data and digital outputs during the project to ensure their long-term value is protected?</strong></li>
							<ul>
								<li>Data management should be at the forefront of your research project from day one. Taking steps early in the process is crucial to ensuring that the long-term value of the data and digital outputs are protected. For best practices and training in data management, explore the resources available in our <a href="https://bfe-inf.github.io/tool-kit/" target="_blank">e-Infrastructures & Data Management Tool Kit</a>, which contains location- and organization-specific resources on data management training, certifications, best practices, and more.</li>
							</ul>
						<li><strong>How and by whom will the data and other digital outputs be managed after the project ends to ensure their long-term accessibility?</strong></li>
							<ul>	
								<li>Determining by whom will the data and other digital outputs be managed after the project ends is a similar process to designating managers of your DDOMP (addressed above). Using the resources below for guidance, consider the training and qualifications among members of your research team that most strongly lends itself to long-term data management:</li>
									<ul style="list-style-type:square">
										<li><a href="https://www.dataone.org/best-practices/define-roles-and-assign-responsibilities-data-management" target="_blank">DataONE: Define roles and assign responsibilities for data management</a></li>
										<li><a href="https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/manage-data/plan/roles-and-responsibilities" target="_blank">UK Data Service: Roles and Responsibilities of data management teams and collaborators</a></li>
									</ul>
								<li>Once you designate the members of the research team who will oversee management of your data and digital outputs after the project ends, begin thinking about how you will share your data to ensure their long-term accessibility. Does your research team currently lack experience in managing and sharing open data? Find more information on best practices in open data sharing in our "Sharing Data" section of the BFE-INF Tool Kit <a href="https://bfe-inf.github.io/tool-kit/bp&s-sharing.html" target="_blank">here.</a> Many researchers choose to place their data in a repository when the project commences. Below are some excellent resources for where your team may choose to store data to ensure their long-term value:</li>
									<ul style="list-style-type:square">
										<li><a href="https://www.re3data.org/" target="_blank">Comprehensive tool kit of repositories and databases for open data, searchable by discipline</a></li>
										<li><a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, a version-control respository allowing researchers to store open data and accompanying licensing and terms of use</li>
									</ul>	
							</ul>				
						<li><strong>What restrictions, if any, do you anticipate could be placed on how the data and digital outputs can be accessed, mined or reused?</strong></li>
							<ul> 
								<li>Your research team will want to include information on how your data and digital outputs will be licensed, and how the licensing outlines terms of access, mining, and reuse. For more information on best practices in licensing, please see the "Licensing" section of the BFE-INF Tool Kit <a href="https://bfe-inf.github.io/tool-kit/bp&s-licensing.html" target="_blank">here.</a></li>
							</ul>		
						<li><strong>How will you ensure that any data security, privacy, and intellectual property restrictions associated with datasets and digital outputs will be honored and preserved in derivative products?</strong></li>
							<ul> 
								<li>While open data can allow increased collaborative research and scientific innovation, many researchers and stakeholders also recognize a privacy risk inherent to open data. It is important that members of your research team understand the privacy risks associated with open data and take measures in your DDOMP to address those risks. For more information on preserving privacy in open data, please read Geothink's Citizen's Guide to Open Data <a href="https://citizens-guide-open-data.github.io/guide/4-od-and-privacy" target="_blank">here</a>. As is the case with the previous question, to ensure that your data is being used appropriately in future derivatives, your research team will want to include information on how your data and digital outputs will be licensed, and how the licensing outlines terms of access, mining, and reuse as they pertain to data security, privacy, and intellectual property restrictions. For more information on best practices in licensing, please see the "Licensing" section of the BFE-INF Tool Kit <a href="https://bfe-inf.github.io/tool-kit/bp&s-licensing.html" target="_blank">here.</a></li>
							</ul>
						<li><strong>What supporting documentation and other information (e.g., metadata) do you plan to make publicly accessible to support the longer-term reuse of the data and digital outputs?</strong></li>
							<ul> 
								<li>Providing supporting metadata with your data is imperative in supporting open data and collaborative research. For resources on creating appropriate metadata for your project, please see the "Metadata" section of the BFE-INF Tool Kit <a href="https://bfe-inf.github.io/tool-kit/bp&s-metadata.html" target="_blank">here.</a></li>
								<li>Many research projects will have supporting documentation (not including metadata) which give other researchers insights into how to reuse the data and digital outputs for continuing research. Consider using a version-control document repository, such as <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>, to store your project's supporting documentation in an accessible format.</li>
							</ul>
						<li><strong>How have you accounted for the costs required to manage the data and digital outputs to ensure long-term accessibility?</strong></li>
							<ul>
								<li>Once your team has an idea of what data you want to store, and who will primarily be in charge of your data management, you will need to estimate potential costs of this storage. The resources below will help your team determine what these costs may be for inclusion in your DDOMP:</li>
									<ul style="list-style-type:square">
										<li><a href="https://www.edugroepen.nl/sites/RDM_platform/Financieel1/Data%20Management%20Costs.aspx" target="_blank">Guide to Research Data Management Costs: provides guidance on how to identify and organize cost categories in your proposal</a></li>
										<li><a href="https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/manage-data/plan/costing" target="_blank">UK Data Service: Data management costing tool</a></li>
									</ul>
								<li>If you are storing your data in an open data repository, remember that these may come with publication costs. In your DDOMP, be sure to address these costs as well as any long-term maintenance costs that come with storing the data. Please see the link below for discipline-specific open data repositories:</li>
									<ul style="list-style-type:square">
										<li><a href="https://www.re3data.org/" target="_blank">Comprehensive tool kit of repositories and databases for open data, searchable by discipline</a></li>
									</ul>
