					<h2>Full Data and Digital Outputs Management Plan</h2>	
					<p>A full Data and Digital Outputs Management Plan for an awarded Belmont Forum project is a living, actively updated document that describes the data management life cycle for the data and other digital outputs to be collected, reused, processed, and/or generated. As part of making research data open by default, findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR), the Plan should elaborate on the information provided at the Full Proposal Stage, and address the additional following questions. Included here are resources and guidance to aid in addressing each question correctly and comprehensively:</p><br/>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>What are the agreed standards to be used for data and metadata formatting and content?</strong></li>
							<ul style="list-style-type:square">
								<li>At this stage of your research project, your DDOMP should clearly outline the specific standards being used for data and metadata formatting and content, and why those standards are appropriate for your project. If this changes during the project, be sure to update the DDOMP with the new information. For resources on creating appropriate metadata for your project, please see the "Metadata" section of the BFE-INF Tool Kit <a href="https://bfe-inf.github.io/tool-kit/bp&s-metadata.html" target="_blank">here</a>. For best practices in data formatting, please see DataONE's resources <a href="https://www.dataone.org/all-best-practices" target="_blank">here</a> by searching for the "format" tag.</li>
							</ul>
						<li><strong>Within the research, what are the policies for broad access and sharing, including provisions for appropriate protection of privacy, confidentiality, security, intellectual property, or other rights or requirements?</strong></li>
							<ul style="list-style-type:square">
								<li>For awarded projects, your research team should outline concrete policies for how your data will be accessed and distributed upon completion of the project with respect to privacy, confidentiality, security, and intellectual property. This information should be detailed within a license that accompanies your data; for resources on creating or adopting a license for your project, please see the "Licensing" section of the BFE-INF Tool Kit <a href="https://bfe-inf.github.io/tool-kit/bp&s-licensing.html" target="_blank">here</a>. Some data repositories will come with standard licensing for all deposited data. If your chosen repository/respository automatically applies a standard license to data, ensure in your DDOMP that this license covers all of the necessary policies for broad access and sharing associated with your data. If the license does not fully cover your data's requirements, address how you will supplement the standard license with further dataset-specific licensing.</li>
							</ul>
						<li><strong>Within the research, what are the policies and provisions for mining, reuse, re-distribution, and the production of derivatives?</strong></li>
							<ul style="list-style-type:square">
								<li>As is the case with the previous question, at this stage of your funded research your DDOMP should describe any restrictions and/or guidelines for accessing your data for future derivatives. Along with the rights and restrictions in the previous question, this information should also be addressed within a license that is applied to your data; if any standard licensing is applied to your dataset after it is deposited into a data repository, ensure within your DDOMP that this license covers all of the necessary policies for mining, reuse, re-distribution, and publications deriving from the data; if the standard license does not address all of these, describe how you will supplement the standard license with further dataset-specific licensing.</li>
							</ul>
						<li><strong>What is the contact information for the person(s) responsible for updating the Data and Digital Outputs Management Plan as needed to comply with these guidelines?</strong></li>
						<li><strong>What is a list of anticipated trustworthy, long-term repositories or data centers that will be used to ensure preservation of access to data and digital outputs following completion of the project?</strong></li>
