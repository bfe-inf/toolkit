					<h2>Preliminary Data and Digital Outputs Management Information</h2>	
					<p>In the Data and Digital Outputs Management section, researchers should address the following questions. Included here are resources for Belmont Forum researchers to address each question correctly and comprehensively:</p><br/>
					<ol>
						<li><strong>What types of datasets and other digital outputs of long-term value do you expect that the project will produce or reuse?</strong></li>
							<ul>
								<li>Considering which data and digital outputs you would like to preserve during and after your research project will help your research team understand how to organize your data management and anticipate certain costs. For best practices on identifying data with long-term value, please visit the following resources:</li> 
									<ul style="list-style-type:square">
										<li><a href="https://dataoneorg.github.io/Education/bp_step/preserve/" target="_blank">DataONE: Decide what data to preserve</a></li>
										<li><a href="https://dataoneorg.github.io/Education/bp_step/analyze/" target="_blank">DataONE: Identify data with long-term value</a></li>
										<li><a href="https://dataoneorg.github.io/Education/bestpractices/store-data-with" target="_blank">DataONE: Store data with appropriate precision</a></li>
									</ul>
							</ul>
						<li><strong>Which member(s) of your team will be responsible for developing, implementing, overseeing, and updating the Data and Digital Outputs Management Plan?</strong></li>
							<ul>
								<li>While all members of your research team should understand and support data management best practices within your project, it is important to delegate the development, implementation, oversight, and maintenance of the DDOMP to collaborators on your team who possess the necessary skillsets and training. For more resources on what to consider as you designate a data manager, please visit the following links:</li>
									<ul style="list-style-type:square">
										<li><a href="https://dataoneorg.github.io/Education/bestpractices/define-roles-and" target="_blank">DataONE: Define roles and assign responsibilities for data management</a></li>
										<li><a href="https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/manage-data/plan/roles-and-responsibilities" target="_blank">UK Data Service: Roles and Responsibilities of data management teams and collaborators</a></li>
									</ul>	
								<li>Does your research team currently lack experience in data management training and best practices? Consider getting up to speed using our <a href="https://bfe-inf.github.io/toolkit/" target="_blank">e-Infrastructures & Data Management Toolkit</a>, which contains location- and organization-specific resources on data management training, certifications, best practices, and more. Prior to submitting a project for funding through a Belmont Forum partner organization, members of your research team should have a general understanding of data management in order to properly complete this portion of the DDOMP. Consider searching for specific resources for your role in your research team in our <a href="https://bfe-inf.github.io/toolkit/dmt-root.html" target="_blank">Data Management Training Inventory</a> in the "By Professional Role" section.</li>
							</ul>
						<li><strong>How have you accounted for the costs required to manage the data and digital outputs to ensure long-term accessibility?</strong></li>
							<ul>
								<li>Once your team has an idea of what data you want to store, and who will primarily be in charge of your data management, you will need to estimate potential costs of this storage. The resources below will help your team determine what these costs may be for inclusion in your DDOMP:</li>
									<ul style="list-style-type:square">
										<li><a href="https://www.edugroepen.nl/sites/RDM_platform/Financieel1/Data%20Management%20Costs.aspx" target="_blank">Guide to Research Data Management Costs: provides guidance on how to identify and organize cost categories in your proposal</a></li>
										<li><a href="https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/manage-data/plan/costing" target="_blank">UK Data Service: Data management costing tool</a></li>
									</ul>
